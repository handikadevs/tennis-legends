Tennis Legends is a fun, interactive, and real-time multiplayer or single-player (against AI) pong-inspired tennis game. The game allows players to control paddles on either side of the screen and try to score points by bouncing a ball past the opponent's paddle. It can be played on desktop or mobile devices with intuitive controls.
